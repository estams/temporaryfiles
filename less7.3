Step 1: Install Ansible on Ubuntu (You can skip this step in case Ansible is already installed)
             1.1 Use the below commands on Ubuntu system to install ansible software.
sudo apt-get install -f
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ansible
 
Step 2: Establish connectivity between ansible controller and node machine
2.1 Establish SSH key pair in linux system to have SSH connectivity with localhost using                                                                                                                                
the following command:
ssh-keygen -t rsa (Press Enter when asked for an input)
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
ssh localhost -p 42006
 

2.1 Now, add the host localhost in ansible host file /etc/ansible/hosts
sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
2.2 When the file opens, add the below two lines of the code at the end of the file if not added already:
[webservers]
localhost:42006
2.3 Execute the below command to validate host inventory file
	ansible -m ping webservers
	sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts

 

Step 3: Write Ansible YAML script to install Apache software 
3.1 Once connectivity is established, add the following code in the apache.yaml file and 
proceed with execution
3.2 Create and open the file using the below command
sudo vi apache2.yaml
 
---
- hosts: webservers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: install apache2
      apt: name=apache2 update_cache=yes state=latest

    - name: enabled mod_rewrite
      apache2_module: name=rewrite state=present
      notify:
         - restart apache2

  handlers:
    - name: restart apache2
      service: name=apache2 state=restarted

Step 4: Run Ansible YAML script
4.1 Run apache.yaml file using the below command: 

ansible-playbook apache2.yaml

4.2 Validate the installation using the command: 
ansible -m shell -a "service apache2 status" webservers
